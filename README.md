# GPT From Scratch

## Details

- The architecture for this model is heavily inspired by Google's paper: __[Attention is all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)__.
- It is a decoder-only Auto Regressive model built from scratch using `pytorch`.
- This model is trained on a Shakespeare's __[verse](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karpathy/char-rnn/master/data/tinyshakespeare/input.txt)__.

## Running it

You can run it from my deployed huggingface's [SPACE](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Ashish-R/LLMFromScratch) ðŸ’–

- Be sure to include text formatted in Shakespeare's style.
- Or you could just use a new line character and see what the GPT generates!
